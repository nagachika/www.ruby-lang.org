There is a buffer under-read vulnerability in `String#unpack` method.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-8778](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8778).

## Details

`String#unpack` receives format specifiers as its parameter, and can be specified the position of parsing the data by the specifier `@`.
If a big number is passed with `@`, the number is treated as the negative value, and out-of-buffer read is occurred.
So, if a script accepts an external input as the argument of `String#unpack`, the attacker can read data on heaps.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
